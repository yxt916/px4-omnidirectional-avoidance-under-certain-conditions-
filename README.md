# px4-omnidirectional-avoidance-under-certain-conditions-
A ROS simulation using stereo, px4 avoidance, deepsort, YOLOv3 and LS. Condition:only "person" are trained and only for uniform linear motion.

TO START
RUN:
roslaunch local_planner local_planner_stereo.launch
roslaunch person_tracking person_tracker.launch
roslaunch transform transform.launch

Then you can start the whole node:

The drone will remember the uniform linear motion of person, when person comes from behind, the drone can still avoidance.
